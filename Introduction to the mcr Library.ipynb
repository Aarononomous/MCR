    "# An Introduction to the `mcr` Library\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an overview to the `mcr` library for creating and studying the Minimum Constraint Removal (MCR) problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not an introduction to the problem itself. Please refer to Hauser's [introduction](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/153e/a4fb187bd0dbda27a51979ff8f09c478bf59.pdf) or the restriction of it to the plane [by Erickson and LaValle](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5363/00838eeb4eefe9bde1cc9e105047f6ca554e.pdf?_ga=1.121233224.1753756452.1479176681) for more information; both are very readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, the problem space is a number of shapes, called __obstacles__, which are placed on a __configuration space__, a square in the plane. They can overlap each other, many times over if wanted. If they overlap the borders of the configuration space, that part is ignored. In addition, there are two points, called the __start__ and __goal__ placed somewhere in the configuration space as well. The __cover__ of any point in the plane is the set of obstacles present at that point. A solution to the MCR problem finds the fewest number of obstacles (the minimum *constraint*) which need to be removed for an unblocked path to be present between the start and goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![basic](basic.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not looking for a specific 2-D path through the plane, but rather a list of sections, overlapped or not, which we'll need to pass throughâ€”the MCR Problem is *discrete*. The problem can be applied to non-spatial instances; its name, \"constraint\" removal, hints at this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the full problem or the restricted, MCR is NP-hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make the reasonable assumption that you have Jupyter running (as you're reading this in a Jupyter notebook right now!) and also that you have a recent version of Python, e.g., 3.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several libraries required by `mcr` that you'll need to install, for graphs (`networkx`), geometric operations (`shapely`), etc., and it's no help that these, like many Python mathematical libraries, are thin wrappers over C++ or Fortran code which need to be built, compiled, linked, etc. on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't do this from scratch: use [conda](https://conda.io/docs/). Download [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io) or install conda yourself. The easiest thing to do is to create a new environment to load all this in, then load it, then run this again.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> conda create --name min_constraint\n",
    "> source activate min_constraint\n",
    "> conda install python=3.6\n",
    "> conda update python\n",
    "> conda install jupyter\n",
    "> conda install pip\n",
    "> conda install networkx\n",
    "> pip install shapely\n",
    "> ...etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've created and entered a new environment, installed (if it's not already) and updated (if it's not already) Python, updated Jupyter, and begun to install all the other libraries. If you can't install something with `conda`, you probably can with `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
